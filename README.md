## Getting Started

To copy the project, clone the repo down using the big green CODE button. Once cloned, run either `yarn` or `npm init` in your terminal, whichever flavor you prefer.

### Prerequisites

  - A computer with the latest install of Node.js
  - A package manager. Either [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) or [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Personally, I like `Yarn`
